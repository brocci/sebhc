# BUILD STEPS FOR MSX GRAPHICS/SOUND AND JOYSTICK MODULE

1. Solder the 3.5mm jack in first making sure it is flush with the PCB

2. Solder the 100UF 25V capacitor and 1K pull down resistor on the back of the PCB. The capacitor is a bit tricky, you will have to cut the leads first to the right length and then solder them on from the back of the PCB.
