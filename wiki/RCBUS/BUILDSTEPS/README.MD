# BUILD STEPS FOR MSX GRAPHICS/SOUND AND JOYSTICK MODULE

1. Solder the 3.5mm jack in first making sure it is flush with the PCB

2. Solder the 100UF 25V capacitor, 1K pull down resistor, 1N4149 diode and wire strap for 0xA0 on the back of the PCB.

8. Solder 1x24 pin female sockets onto the underside of the Tang Nano 9K. To program the Tang Nano 9K with the F18A core visit this page [here](https://github.com/sebhc/sebhc/wiki/F18A-TMS9918-FPGA-EMULATOR) - specifically you will want to download the <b>tn9k_f18a.fs</b> file stream file and the GoWin software. [Here](https://github.com/sebhc/sebhc/blob/master/wiki/F18ACLONE/Programming_Tang_Nano_9K_for_H8-8-3.txt) are the steps for programming the Tang Nano. When installing the GoWin software you only need to install the programmer software not the design software.
