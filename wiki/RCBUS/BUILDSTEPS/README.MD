# BUILD STEPS FOR MSX GRAPHICS/SOUND AND JOYSTICK MODULE

1. Solder the 3.5mm jack in first making sure it is flush with the PCB

2. Solder the 100UF 25V capacitor and 1K pull down resistor on the back of the PCB. The capacitor is a bit tricky, you will have to cut the leads first to the right length and then solder them on from the back of the PCB.

3. Solder the diode to the back of the PCB as shown

6. Solder in the two 2x5 header pins for the joysticks and the RCBus right angle headers

9. Install the chips

10. Solder 1x24 pin female sockets onto the underside of the Tang Nano 9K. To program the Tang Nano 9K with the F18A core visit this page [here](https://github.com/sebhc/sebhc/wiki/F18A-TMS9918-FPGA-EMULATOR) - specifically you will want to download the <b>tn9k_f18a.fs</b> file stream file and the GoWin software. [Here](https://github.com/sebhc/sebhc/blob/master/wiki/F18ACLONE/Programming_Tang_Nano_9K_for_H8-8-3.txt) are the steps for programming the Tang Nano. When installing the GoWin software you only need to install the programmer software not the design software.
